    Yodha Arc – Cavill Physique Coach (MVP)

    This is the entry point for the PWA. It loads our application code from
    ``app.js`` and styles from ``style.css``. The head section contains
    meta‑tags required to enable progressive‑web‑app functionality (add to
    homescreen, full screen, etc.) as well as linking the web app manifest
    (``manifest.json``) and registering the service worker (in ``app.js``).

    The HTML structure is intentionally minimal because almost all content is
    generated dynamically by JavaScript. The main container ``#app`` is
    populated once the script has executed.

      Load the application script. The ``defer`` attribute ensures the
      script executes only after the HTML is parsed. All application logic
      resides in this file, including UI rendering, data persistence, and
      workout generation. See ``app.js`` for details.
